      <p> Creating and designing website is my passion and I just recently discovered it when I took the Web developing subject
        but I'm originally started in desktop developing such as POS or point of sale application. the language I use before was c# .net I also have
        basic experience in game developing using unity but my pc cant handle high graphics so I switch to python and learned data structures but I did'nt like it so before I came here and created this website I have encoutered many challenges. so im gonna be glad if you find me a worthy scholar in your team, thanks for having a time reading about me.
